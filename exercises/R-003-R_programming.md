    Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, heights_no_na, with the NAs removed.

    heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

    Use the function median() to calculate the median of the heights vector.

    Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
